Social Media Application

This is a full-stack social media application built using Next.js. The app enables users to sign up, log in, manage profiles, and create posts. It uses Clerk for secure authentication and Radix UI Primitives for a modern, intuitive user experience.

üåü Features

User Stories

	1.	Secure Authentication with Clerk
Users can securely sign up and log in to the application using Clerk. This allows them to interact with the app, create posts, and edit their profiles.
	2.	Error Page for Invalid Profiles
Users are informed with a custom error page if they try to visit a user profile that doesn‚Äôt exist, ensuring a seamless user experience.
	3.	Modern User Experience
The app uses Radix UI Primitives (or a similar library) to deliver enhanced and intuitive UI components.
	4.	Profile Management
Users can create and manage their profiles, including adding personal information such as a biography, for a personalised experience.
	5.	Post Creation and Management
Users can create posts that are displayed on their profile pages, allowing them to share and manage content easily.

Key Requirements

	1.	Secure Sign-Up and Login
	‚Ä¢	Technology Used: Clerk for authentication.
	‚Ä¢	Users can sign up and log in securely to access their profiles and interact with the application.
	‚Ä¢	User data is stored in a PostgreSQL database and associated with the unique Clerk userId.
	2.	Custom Error Page
	‚Ä¢	A not-found.jsx component displays a custom error page when a user tries to access an invalid profile URL (e.g., /user/[nonexistent]).
	3.	Enhanced UI with Radix UI Primitives
	‚Ä¢	Radix UI Primitives were used for implementing key components like modals, forms, and navigation menus.
	‚Ä¢	The modern design enhances usability and aesthetics.
	4.	User Profiles
	‚Ä¢	Users can input personal information (e.g., biography) through a form.
	‚Ä¢	Profiles are managed at the route /user/[userId], allowing personalised data to be stored and retrieved efficiently.
	‚Ä¢	Profiles are tied to the Clerk userId for secure data association.
	‚Ä¢	Profile data is stored in a PostgreSQL database.
	5.	Post Creation and Display
	‚Ä¢	Users can create posts via a form.
	‚Ä¢	Posts are stored in the database and displayed on the user‚Äôs profile page.

    üåü Reflection

I really enjoyed this project. I felt stretched at times but confident that I had the fundamental knowledge to implement everything I wanted. This was the biggest project I have worked on to date, and I found myself getting lost or going down code rabbit holes occasionally. To overcome this, I took time out to plan my approach and created a checklist, which helped me stay focused and productive.
